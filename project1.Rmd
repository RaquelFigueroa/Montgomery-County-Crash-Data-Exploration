```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
dat = read.csv("/Users/raquel/Desktop/Spring 2018/dataScience/project/Crash_Reporting_-_Drivers_Data.csv")
```

## Project Introduction

=> explain what you will do in a sentence or two <=

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Project Data

=> Explain in a few sentence where the data comes from, what it is about, etc. <=

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


## Initial data exploration

```{r test, echo=FALSE}
accident.times = data.frame(Longitude=dat$Longitude, Latitude=dat$Latitude, hour=strptime(as.character(dat$Crash.Date.Time), "%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p", tz = "America/New_York")$hour + 1, dat$Collision.Type)
#1: ratio of colision types per hour
#table showing num accidents depend on hour/collision type
hr.table=table(accident.times$hour, accident.times$dat.Collision.Type)

# clean data of UNKNOWN, OTHER, N/A values:
cols = c("ANGLE MEETS LEFT HEAD ON","ANGLE MEETS LEFT TURN", "ANGLE MEETS RIGHT TURN","HEAD ON","HEAD ON LEFT TURN","OPPOSITE DIR BOTH LEFT TURN","OPPOSITE DIRECTION SIDESWIPE",                       
          "SAME DIR BOTH LEFT TURN","SAME DIR REAR END", "SAME DIR REND LEFT TURN","SAME DIR REND RIGHT TURN","SAME DIRECTION LEFT TURN","SAME DIRECTION RIGHT TURN",   
          "SAME DIRECTION SIDESWIPE","SINGLE VEHICLE","STRAIGHT MOVEMENT ANGLE")
plot(hr.table[,cols], las=1, col=rainbow(16), main = "Ratios of Collisions per Hour of the Day")
legend('topleft',legend = cols,col=rainbow(16),pch=19, cex=0.6, pt.cex = 1, y.intersp = 1.5)
```

## Data cleaning and preprocessing

=> Add stuff here <=



## Conclusions

=> One paragraph about what you learned, issues you faced, etc. <=
